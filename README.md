# Books data load and exploration

This is a private book library data load and exploration.

Since our private library was first assembled (my husband's and mine), some years ago, we have been keeping track of our books in text files, using a proprietary format based in key-value to make the data easy to be read. Something like this:

```
type=book
subtype=nonfiction
subtype=fiction

title=There Are No Electrons
subtitle=Electronics for Earthlings
author=Kenn Amdahl
alt_author=Kenneth Amdahl
publisher=Clearwater Publishing
year=1998
year_first_publication=1991
num_pages=322

isbn=0-9627815-9-2
lang=en_US

keyword=Electronics
keyword=Jargon
keyword=Static Electricity
...
```

Each book has its own file, stored in folders from A-Z according to the main author's last name. With time, new books arrived, and their data was added to this text files collection as well. It's a large collection we're very proud of, but not even close as large as [Umberto Eco's home library](https://www.openculture.com/2017/03/watch-umberto-eco-walk-through-his-immense-private-library.html) (well, not yet).

Now it's the first time I'm actually reading the book files, to extract stats and indulge ourselves by looking at our beautiful library from a different angle. üìö‚ù§Ô∏è
